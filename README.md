#DESCRIPTION#

TASK:TO BUILD A SIMPLE LEXICAL ANALYZER THAT IDENTIFIES KEYWORDS, OPERATORS, AND IDENTIFIERS FROM AN INPUT FILE.

COMPILER DESIGN BASICS
A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. 

The compilation process involves several stages:

1.LEXICAL ANALYSIS: breaking the source code into individual tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

2.SYNTAX ANALYSIS: parsing the tokens into a parse tree, which represents the syntactic structure of the program.

3 SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: analyzing the parse tree to check for semantic errors, such as type errors or undefined variables.

4.INTERMEDIATE CODE GENERATION: generating intermediate code, such as assembly code or bytecode, from the parse tree.

5.OPTIMIZATION: optimizing the intermediate code to improve performance or reduce size.

6.CODE GENERATION: generating machine code from the optimized intermediate code.


LEXICAL ANALYZER:-

A lexical analyzer, also known as a scanner or tokenizer, is a program that performs the lexical analysis stage of the compilation process. Its main task is to break the source code into individual tokens.

The lexical analyzer identifies the following types of tokens:

1.KEYWORDS: reserved words in the programming language, such as if, while, or int.

2.IDENTIFIERS: names given to variables, functions, or labels.

3. OPERATORS: symbols used for arithmetic, comparison, or logical operations, such as +, -, *, or ==.

4.LITERALS: constant values, such as numbers or strings.

5.SYMBOLS: punctuation characters, such as (, ), [, or ].


TO CREATE A LEXICAL ANALYZER, WE FOLLOW THESE STEPS:-

1. DEFINE THE TOKEN TYPES: identify the types of tokens in the programming language.

2. WRITE REGULAR EXPRESSION: write regular expressions to match each token type.

3. CHOOSE  A LEXICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE: decide whether to write a hand-written lexical analyzer or use a lexer generator.

4.IMPLEMENT THE LEXICAL ANALYZER: write the code for the lexical analyzer, either by hand or using a lexer generator.
